# JavaScript Array Function Examples

This repository contains a set of JavaScript functions that demonstrate various array manipulation techniques using `map`, `forEach`, and `for` loops. Each function serves a different purpose and showcases how to work with arrays effectively.

## Contents

1. **power(array)**
    - This function takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array where each element is the result of raising 2 to the power of the corresponding element in the input array.

2. **oddOrEven(array)**
    - This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each element is either the string "even" or "odd", based on the parity of the corresponding input value. If an element is not a number, "N/A" is placed instead.

3. **Printing Names Using `forEach`**
    - This example demonstrates how to print all the names in an array using the `forEach` loop.

4. **fizzBuzz(array)**
    - This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each element is either the number itself, "Fizz", "Buzz", or "Fizz Buzz" based on certain rules (divisibility by 3, 5, or both).
